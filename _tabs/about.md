Hello!

My name is Jacob Bettinger and I am Computer Science Major at Michigan State University! 
I have a passion for programming and game design, and this website acts as an introduction to who I am and what I can do.
It showcases some of my academic background, technical skills, projects, and some of my hobbies.

If you have any questions please reach out through my socials below.
