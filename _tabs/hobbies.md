I have a wide range of hobbies that keep me engaged and active. Apart from coding I enjoy gaming, preferably online competitive games like FPS and MOBA. I do also 
enjoy making games and have experimented with 2D, 3D, and board-style games. I find that creating stories and making narratives that people can get immersed in 
satisfying, my goal is to hopefully have a career in game design.

I enjoy reading, mostly fantasy books but I also enjoy reading manga and watching anime. I've had this interest for most of my life and it's one of my favorite ways to pass the time, I love immersing myself in fantasy worlds and experiencing different stories.

I have a passion for cooking, it began when I worked as a dishwasher in 2021 by simply observing the kitchen, and it evolved into something I take great pride in and spend most of my time practicing and trying new dishes. I started work as a line cook in May, 2023 and I learned a lot since that time, met a lot of different chefs that take passion in their work and it inspires me to be more creative.

I also like staying physically active, I go on frequent runs and I spend a lot of my time when I am not working on school or participating in my other hobbies at the gym. Since June, 2023 I've lost around 80+ pounds and have changed my lifestyle completely to a more healthy and productive one.
