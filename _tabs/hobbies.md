I have a wide range of hobbies that keep me engaged and active. Apart from coding I enjoy gaming, preferably online competitive games like FPS and MOBA games. I do also enjoy making games and have experimented with 2D, 3D, and board-style games. I enjoy reading, mostly fantasy books but I also enjoy reading manga and watching anime. I have a passion for cooking, it began when I worked as a dishwasher in 2021 by simply observing the kitchen, and it evolved into something I take great pride in and spend most of my time practicing and trying new dishes. I like staying physically active, I go on frequent runs and I spend a lot of my time when I am not working on school or participating in my other hobbies at the gym.
