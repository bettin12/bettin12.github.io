# Car Dealership
CSC 2110 - WSU

Created a car dealership program in C++ that mimics the functionality of a real-life car dealership. Users can sell and buy cars from a pre-existing 
inventory that is auto-sorted and adjustable with file manipulation. Users can request specific info for cars in the system and can filter their
search to get a list of cars that match their requirements.
